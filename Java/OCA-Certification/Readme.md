# Java Building Blocks

## Java Classes vs Files

Multiple classes are allowed to be defined in one file, but only one of the is allowed to be declared as `public.`

```java
class Fruit {
    
}

public class Apple extends Fruit {
    
}

// !!! ERROR - Following class definition not allowed to be public
public class Pear extends Fruit {
    
}
```
The file name mast match the name of `public` class and  `.java` as extension.
```java
// File Fruit.java
public class Fruit {
	// ...
}
```
After compilation the resulted file will have the name `Fruit.class`.

**Summary**
* Each file should contain only one class
* The filename must match class name and `.java` extension

## The entry point
A program written in Java has it's entry point in `main()` method.
```java
public static void main(String argc[]) {
	// ...
}
```
A non `public` or non `static` method with name `main()` is not considered entry point.
The arguments of the method are also important, it should be an array of `String` which mean the following declarations are valid:
* `String[] argc`
* `String argc[]`
* `String ... argc`

**Summary**
* The entry point method must be named `main()`
* The method must be `public`
* The method must be `static`
* The method should accept only one argument, an array of `String`

## Packages
Java classes can be (and it is recommended) to be grouped in packages.
In case the class does not have the `package` statement as first line then it is considered to be in `default` package.
```java
public class Apple {
}
```
The above class is defined in `default` package. 

And the following class is placed in `com.foo.fruit` package.

```java
package com.foo.fruit;

public class Pear {
}
```
The package name also represent the directory structure of the project. The above class `Pear` should be placed in `com/foo/fruit` directory relative to you root folder and the class `Apple` should be placed directly in root folder.

### Name convention & rules
Package names are written in all lower case to avoid conflict with the names of classes or interfaces.

Companies use their reversed Internet domain name to begin their package names, for example, `com.fuitcompany.fruit` for a package named mypackage created by a programmer at `com.fuitcompany`.

The allowed naming rule is the same as for variables.
A package can be of any length of unicode letter or digit. It should begin with letter, dollar sign (`$`) or underscore (`_`).


**TODO:** Rule for packge names.

The package `java.lang` is auto imported and do not require explicit declaration.

### Wildcard
Java allow to import all classes from one package with one import statment.

```java
import com.foo.fruits.*;
```

The `import` statment in combination with wildcard can **not** import:
* Child packages
* Methods and Fields
* Cannot be placeholder

```java
import java.util.*.*; // The wildcard can be only at the end
import java.util.*; // The class java.util.file.Files will not be imported
import java.util.file.Files.*; // Methods are not imported
```

### Redundant Imports
If a wildcard is used to import some class(es) then a statment which import concrete class from same package is redundant. 
Same is true for auto imported package `java.lang`.

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.Random; // Redundant
import java.lang.String; // Redundant
```

### Naming conflicts
Java will not be able to compile in case two objects with same name are imported. This may happen in cases like:
* Two packages are imported using wildcard which contains a class with same name
```java
import java.util.*; // Contains class Date
import java.sql.*; // Contains class Date
```
* Two classes with same name a explcit imported from different packages
```java
import java.util.Date;
import java.sql.Date;
```

The explicit import take precedence over wildcard import.
```java
import java.sql.Date;
import java.util.*; // The java.util.Date is not imported because above explicit import
```

In case both classes should be used, then Java offer two solutions:
1. Use of fully qualified names
```java
// No imports
public class Fruit {
	private java.util.Date processedDate;
	private java.sql.Date dbSavedDate;
}
```
2. Use wildcard or explicit import and fully qualified name
```java
import java.util.Date; // Or import java.util.*

public class Fruit {
	private Date processedDate;
	private java.sql.Date dbSavedDate;
}
```
