# SOLID
* **S** - ***Single responsability***<br />
"There should never be more than one reason for a class to change."[2] In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.
* **O** - ***Open/Closed principle***<br />
"Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
* **L** - ***Liskov substitution principle***<br />
"Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it."
* **I** - ***Interface segregation principle***<br />
"Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use."
